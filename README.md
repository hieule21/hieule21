### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In the past few years at St. Thomas, I learnt a lot about Computer Science disciplines, ranging from Data Strucutres, Algorithms, to Web Development. Listed below are the three projects that reflects my learning the courses I took:

- [CV Builder](https://github.com/hieule21/cv-builder): It was one of my first personal projects and helped me land a few internships in the past. The web app allows tech workers specifically boostrap a professional resume in minutes by filling in a few information forms. It is useful for who is looking for a nice and pre-defined resume format and landing interviews. I learnt lots of things by working on this app such as user authentication, REST APIs, client-side rendering framework. 

- [COVID Tracker](https://github.com/hieule21/covid-tracker): I made this app during the COVID pandemic to observe how the pandemic affects people. I shared this application with my friends and family to help raise awareness. The application converts raw data about COVID cases into high-quality information displayed in chart, so that users can easily take a look at how bad the situation was, and hopefully stop the spread.

- [RapiD](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/RapiD): RapiD is an open-source project managed by Meta engineers. I had a chance to contribute to the project during my fellowship with Major League Hacking. I worked on a new map layer on OpenStreetMap that allows user to add/edit map objects (utility poles, bike racks, trafic lights, ...) detected by the satellites. Allow users to add and view newly added ultility poles or bike racks on the map, the new map layer helps improve the power grid mapping situation in West Africa and also promotes cycling over driving in Europe.
